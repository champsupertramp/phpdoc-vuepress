# Getting started

## Requirements

- PHP >= 5.6
- Node.js >= 8
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (or npm).

### Dependencies

This template is designed for [phpDocumentor 2](https://www.phpdoc.org/) and [VuePress 0.x](https://v0.vuepress.vuejs.org/).

> This template may be compatible with upcoming **phpDocumentor3** and **VuePress** v1.0.0, but will not be documented at the moment while they are unstable.

You can globally install them:

```bash
# phpDocumentor2
composer global require phpdocumentor/phpdocumentor:^2.9.0

# VuePress
yarn global add vuepress
```

> Read about [VuePress install](https://v0.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html).



## Installation

Install `nelson6e65/phpdoc-vuepress` with composer:

```bash
composer require --dev nelson6e65/phpdoc-vuepress
```

> You may need to set the composer option [minimum-stability](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability) to 'dev' in order to be able to install pre-releases.


## Configuration

Go to [Configuration](configuration.md) in order to see how to configure.


## Usage

Run phpDocumentor and set template as `vendor/nelson6e65/phpdoc-vuepress/data/templates/vuepress`:


```bash
phpdoc -d="src/" -t="docs/api/" --template="vendor/nelson6e65/phpdoc-vuepress/data/templates/vuepress"
```

> More information about the available arguments can be found at [running phpDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/guides/running-phpdocumentor.html).


Then, you can update your VuePress pages with `vuepress` for your docs:

```bash
vuepress build docs # if you installed vuepress globally
```




## Recommendations

- **Do not track the API route directory with Git**. This files are auto-generated with the `phpdoc` tool, so there is not need to track them. Add to your `.gitignore`:
```bash
# Autogenerated API documentation
docs/api/
```

- **Restrict visibility to protected members**. By default, all members are parsed. So, you need to config `--visibility` to ignore `private` methods:
```bash
phpdoc --visibility="public,protected"
```
or
```xml
  <parser>
    <!-- Only Public and Protected members are parsed -->
    <visibility>public,protected</visibility>
  </parser>
```
